# The Data Management
We use the STACFinder Database for collecting data during the crawling process. For this purpose, we have four tables:
1. catalogs: table with the stac index catalogs
2. urlQueue: table to save the queue of uncrawled urls
3. sources: table to save informations about sources of collections
4. collections: table to save informations about the crawled collections. These are the informations you can look at on the STACFinder Website.

If you want to have a closer look on the collected data or our database, you can get access to our STACFinder Database as it is described in the [Database Documentation](../database/database-access.md).
